This is the source code for the work-in-progress milestone 3 build
of my clone of the Midway Acrade classic port of "Wizard of Wor": 
"The Incredible Wizard" for the Bally Astrocade system. 

Milestone 3 contains all functionality for the final product with
the exception of game progression logic (menus, difficulty, spawning
enemies, tracking player lives, advancing levels, etc).

The project is a learning experience to help me develop game programming
skills and experiment with agile software development. The game is built 
in Adobe Flash CS4 with ActionScript 3.0. All source is distributed with 
the Apache 2.0 License.

  MILESTONE 1: Scenegraph
  MILESTONE 2: Actors, Movement, Projectiles
 *MILESTONE 3: AI, Collision Detection
